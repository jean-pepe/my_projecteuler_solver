# A collection of my code to solve the Project Eulero question

What is Project Euler?

Project Euler [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems.

obviously with almost 1000 problems it is impossible that I will complete the site but by publishing my code online I hope that I will find some motivation to maintain consistency and reach the goal of 100 solved problems
